# Dormitory_Management_System
The Dormitory is where I store source code, this project is written with eclipse ide and java version 18.0.1.1
DormitoryManagement.jar is an executable file, you should use java versions equal to or higher than the version I use to run the program.
And the last one is the report.
Thank you for reading.
